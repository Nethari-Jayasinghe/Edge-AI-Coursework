**Abstract**
The project aims to develop an application named "Rumble" to address the issue of human-elephant conflicts in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Using Raspberry Pi devices equipped with a camera and vibration sensor, the application detects elephants near homes and crops. The user interface includes login functionality and a dashboard displaying real-time data such as date, time, number of elephants detected, and corresponding photos. Future enhancements are outlined in the "coming soon" section, indicating ongoing development efforts to improve the model, user interface, and sensor integration. The core functionality of Rumble involves the detection of elephants through sensor data, which is processed by a machine learning model. The results are then transmitted to a cloud platform for storage and retrieval. Additionally, the cloud platform manages user login information for security purposes. The project aims to provide an effective solution for mitigating human-elephant conflicts by enabling proactive detection for users in vulnerable areas.
