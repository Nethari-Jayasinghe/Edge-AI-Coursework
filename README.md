**Abstract**

The project aims to develop an application named "Rumble" to address the issue of human-elephant conflicts in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Using Raspberry Pi devices equipped with a camera and vibration sensor, the application detects elephants near homes and crops. The user interface includes login functionality and a dashboard displaying real-time data such as date, time, number of elephants detected, and corresponding photos. Future enhancements are outlined in the "coming soon" section, indicating ongoing development efforts to improve the model, user interface, and sensor integration. The core functionality of Rumble involves the detection of elephants through sensor data, which is processed by a machine learning model. The results are then transmitted to a cloud platform for storage and retrieval. Additionally, the cloud platform manages user login information for security purposes. The project aims to provide an effective solution for mitigating human-elephant conflicts by enabling proactive detection for users in vulnerable areas.

**CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 Problem Background**

Sri Lanka's captivating landscape and rich wildlife have long attracted global attention (Gunawansa et al., 2023). The allure of observing majestic elephants in their natural habitat is a highlight for many visitors. However, alongside this charm, human-elephant interactions bring significant risks. These interactions pose challenges in Sri Lanka, leading to conflicts that endanger both humans and elephants (Rathnayake et al., 2022).

Human-elephant conflicts have become a prominent issue in Sri Lanka, affecting various sectors and prompting urgent mitigation calls (Xu, Jiang, & Liu, 2024). These conflicts often result in property damage, crop loss, and unfortunately, loss of human lives (Madarasinghe et al., 2024). Particularly in rural areas where communities live near elephant habitats, these confrontations highlight the delicate balance between human activities and wildlife conservation (Withanage et al., 2023).

Such conflicts threaten human safety, infrastructure, and livelihoods, with elephants causing extensive damage to homes and infrastructure (KÃ¶pke et al., 2023). The Department of Wildlife Conservation has reported 375 human fatalities from elephant attacks over the past decade, along with significant crop damage, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation strategies (Gunawansa et al., 2023; Rathnayake et al., 2022).

This paper aims to delve into the complexities of human-elephant conflicts in Sri Lanka, assessing the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to this pressing issue. By integrating insights from diverse research, we aim to contribute to sustainable strategies for mitigating human-elephant conflicts.

**1.2 Problem Statement**

The escalating conflicts between humans and wild elephants in Sri Lanka's rural areas pose significant threats to safety and livelihoods. Proximity between elephant habitats and human settlements has led to substantial property damage and increased risks to human lives.

There's an urgent need for effective mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of both humans and elephants, protect rural communities' social and economic well-being, and promote harmonious coexistence between humans and wildlife.

The complex nature of these conflicts underscores the intricate relationship between human activities and wildlife conservation. Without proactive measures to address the root causes, the cycle of conflicts will persist, undermining conservation efforts and rural livelihoods.

**1.3 Aim of Project**

The project aims to develop an application named Rumble using Raspberry Pi devices equipped with a camera and vibration sensor. This application detects elephant presence near specified areas like homes and crops.

The Rumble app features a user-friendly interface with login functionality and a dashboard displaying detection data, including date, time, and elephant photos.
